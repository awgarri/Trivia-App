# Triviana!

## Description:

Triviana is a timed, multiple-choice trivia game. It generates a chosen number of random questions using a trivia API and populates fake answers using Wikidata. The user's time and correct answer total are logged to be shared on a leaderboard. The user can also create an account in order to keep track of their quiz statistics.

## Feature: 

- Leaderboard: This feature is a global leaderboard where users are ranked based on their performance in Trivia game.
- Buzzed out: This feature will create a sound effect if the user ran out of time to answer the question or got it wrong.
- Pics: This feature will give the user a picture for some specific questions and they will answer accordingly.
- Questionnaires: This feature will give users to set how many questions of a single trivia game they want to play
- Soundtrack: This feature will have background music in the game and music for each question that a user answers correctly.
